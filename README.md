# TukuToi-Blocks-Templates
Create complete WordPress Template Layouts for content, header, footer and sidebars in the WordPress backend using Gutenberg Blocks

Currently a plugin this might become a Theme later.

# Usage

- Install and Activate like any other WordPress Plugin
- Upon actication 2 new menus in the WordPress admin will appear: Reusable Blocks (WordPress native but hidden post type) and **Templates**. 
- The **Templates** menu is where you'll create your Template Layouts. 
- When adding a new Template you'll find a Gutenberg Sidebar Menu **Template Settings** where you will be able to name your template, and define its type + assign eventual header and footer template.
==> If you can't find the menu, see [here](https://www.tukutoi.com/doc/create-template-layouts-with-tukutoi-blocks-templates/) how to activate it.
